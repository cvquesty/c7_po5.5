# Vagrant/Puppet with r10k

You have to first:

`vagrant plugin install vagrant-pe_build`
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-hosts`

Simply clone the repository and do a `vagrant up`

If your Virutalbox and Vagrant work well together, and the vagrant plugins mentioned above are installed and functional, when this vagrant is done you will have an "as close to as puppet approved configuration" as is possible in an automated standup.
